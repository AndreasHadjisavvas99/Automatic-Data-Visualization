# Automatic Data Visualization with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Diploma Thesis: **"Automatic Data Visualization with Machine Learning"**. The project proposes a recommendation-based visualization system for data analytics, using machine learning techniques to assist users in selecting optimal visualizations based on their data characteristics and goals.

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning-powered recommendation system that automates data visualization, streamlining the process for users in data analytics. By implementing and comparing various machine learning algorithms, the project evaluates how well each algorithm and AutoML tool performs in recommending accurate and relevant visualizations.

## Methodology

The following steps were conducted in developing this system:
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Aggregating relevant datasets and preparing them by cleaning and pre-processing.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and transforming features to improve model accuracy.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training multiple machine learning algorithms to compare performance.
4. **AutoML Implementation**: Experimenting with AutoML tools like AutoKeras and AutoGluon to automate the model selection process.
5. **Web Application Deployment**: Deploying the recommendation system via a web application for user interaction.

## Machine Learning Models Evaluated

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

In addition to these, AutoML frameworks like **AutoKeras** and **AutoGluon** were tested to streamline model selection and parameter tuning.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Languages and Libraries**: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **AutoML Tools**: AutoKeras, AutoGluon
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit

## Results and Findings

The performance of each machine learning algorithm and AutoML tool was evaluated based on accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for different types of data visualizations. The final deployment includes a web app that users can access to automatically generate recommended visualizations.
